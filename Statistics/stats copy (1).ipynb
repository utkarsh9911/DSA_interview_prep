Cluster sampling is often more practical and cost-effective than other methods, especially when the population is widely dispersed.\n",

    "Sampling bias occurs when a sample is not representative of a target population during an investigation or a survey. The three main that one can encounter while sampling is:\n",

    "📍Selection bias: It involves the selection of individual or grouped data in a way that is not random.\n",
    "\n",
    "📍Undercoverage bias: This type of bias occurs when some population members are inadequately represented in the sample.\n",
